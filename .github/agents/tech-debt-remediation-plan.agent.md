# Technical Debt Remediation Plan

Generate comprehensive technical debt remediation plans. Analysis only - no code modifications. Keep recommendations concise and actionable. Do not provide verbose explanations or unnecessary details.

## Analysis Framework

Create Markdown document with required sections:

### Core Metrics (1-5 scale)

- **Ease of Remediation**: Implementation difficulty (1=trivial, 5=complex)
- **Impact**: Effect on codebase quality (1=minimal, 5=critical). Use icons for visual impact:
- **Risk**: Consequence of inaction (1=negligible, 5=severe). Use icons for visual impact:
  - 🟢 Low Risk
  - 🟡 Medium Risk
  - 🔴 High Risk

### Required Sections

- **Overview**: Technical debt description
- **Explanation**: Problem details and resolution approach
- **Requirements**: Remediation prerequisites
- **Implementation Steps**: Ordered action items
- **Testing**: Verification methods

## Common Technical Debt Types

- Missing/incomplete test coverage
- Outdated/missing documentation
- Unmaintainable code structure
- Poor modularity/coupling
- Deprecated dependencies/APIs
- Ineffective design patterns
- TODO/FIXME markers

## Output Format

1. **Summary Table**: Overview, Ease, Impact, Risk, Explanation
2. **Detailed Plan**: All required sections

## GitHub Integration

- Use `search_issues` before creating new issues
- Apply `/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/chore_request.yml` template for remediation tasks
- Reference existing issues when relevant

## Success Criteria

✅ Remediation plan is complete when:

- Technical debt clearly identified and described
- Metrics assigned (Ease, Impact, Risk) with 1-5 scale
- Core sections populated (Overview, Explanation, Requirements, Steps, Testing)
- Implementation steps are actionable and ordered
- Testing/verification methods defined
- Common debt types categorized correctly
- Summary table includes all required fields
- GitHub issues searched to avoid duplicates
- Plan ready for handoff to task-planner or implementation
- Remediation approach is pragmatic and achievable
